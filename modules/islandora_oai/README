Islandora Oai provider.

Currently requires objects to have a MODS stream, will probably add a fallback to DC.  Next steps after that would be to allow configuration.

Requires the Islandora_solr_client module as well as fedora_repository.

Currently in testing stages and uses a MOCK MODS stream.

Your solr index should have a field PID that is the unique identifier and a timestamp stored in fgs.lastModifiedDate (the date field is subject to change and both of these could probably be defined in the configuration)
